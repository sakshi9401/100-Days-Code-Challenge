                5 for Modulus
                6 for Square
                7 for Square Root                    
                8 for Cube
                9 for Cube Root
                        4
                you choose 4
                Division of -6 and 4 is -2
                
### Test Case 3 :
                Enter a number : 27
                Enter your choice :
                1 for Addition
                2 for subtraction
                3 for Multiplication                    
                4 for Division 
                5 for Modulus
                6 for Square
                7 for Square Root                    
                8 for Cube
                9 for Cube Root
                        9
                you choose 9
                Cube Root of 27 is 3.0
