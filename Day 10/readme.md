# Question: List Comprehension in Python
## Language Used: Python Language
### Input: You are given three integers x and y representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n.use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops
### Output: Display all the possible coordinates whose sum is not equal to n.

### Test Case 1:
                1
                1
                2
                [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
