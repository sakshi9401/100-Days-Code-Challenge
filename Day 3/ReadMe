Explanation :
	 An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its    
	digits is equal to the number itself.
	
	Test Case 1: num = 153 
	       	         L = 3
                     Num not equal to 0
        Sum =  (1**1) + (5**3) + (3**3) 
        If sum equals to num.
Hence, 153 is an armstrong number.
		
Test Case 2: num = 1634 
                      L = 4
	          Num not equal to 0
         	          Sum = (1**4) + (6**4) + (3**4) + (4**4)
	          If sum equals to num..
         Hence, 1634 is an armstrong number.

Test Case 3: num = -153
	           Return  False
