# Question : Find Factorial of a number 

## Language Used : Python 

### Implemented this problem in 3 ways 
    1) Using Simple programe
    2) Using Function i.e., def function
    3) Using recursion 
    
    
## Input: Take input from user

## Logic : 
          Factorial of a number is the sum of multiplication of all the integers smaller than that positive integer. 
          eg.,ctorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which equals to 120.
     
## Test Case 1:
      Take input from user 
          num = 5
          Fact is a variable in which we store factorial of a number
          where i is a number of iteration 
          fact = 1
          Fact = fact * i
          Fact = 1 * 1 = 1
          Fact = 1 * 2 = 2
          Fact = 2 * 3 = 6
          Fact = 6 * 4 = 24
          Fact = 24 * 5 = 120
      
## Test Case 2:
     Take input from user 
          num = 0
          Fact is a variable in which we store factorial of a number
          where i is a number of iteration 
          fact = 1
          Fact = fact * i
          Factorial of 0 is 1.
          
## Test Case 3:
     Take input from user 
          num = 1
          Fact is a variable in which we store factorial of a number
          where i is a number of iteration 
          fact = 1
          Fact = fact * i
          Factorial of 1 is 1.
        
## Test Case 4
     Take input from user 
          num = -5
          Fact is a variable in which we store factorial of a number
          where i is a number of iteration 
          fact = 1
          Fact = fact * i
          Factorial of -5 is -120.
