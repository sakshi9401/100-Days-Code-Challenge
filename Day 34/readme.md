# Question : 
              Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.
              Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. 
              One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with                     
              distinct heights in her greenhouse.

 ## Input : 
            The first line contains the integer, N , the size of array .
            The second line contains the N space-separated integers,arr[i].
            
## Output : 
            Return average height
            
### Test Case : 
                   STDIN                                        Function
                   -----                                        --------
                    10                                          arr[] size N = 10
                    161 182 161 154 176 170 167 171 170 174     arr = [161, 181, ..., 174]
                    
                    169.375
